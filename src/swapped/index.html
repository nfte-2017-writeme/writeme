                <p>I've only ever experienced sexism outside of my own home ironically. Being a twin was always an awkward task because we got different chores and responsibilities mostly because of our gender. Therefore whereas I was able to go out at times, my sister wasn't because "she is a girl" and "anything can happen to her". I think it was all out of good intention but bad approach.</p>

                <p>I do not consider benevolent sexism a good thing, for despite the positive feelings it may indicate for the perceiver, its underpinnings lie in traditional stereotyping and masculine dominance (e.g., the man as the provider and woman as his dependent), and its consequences are often damaging. Benevolent sexism is not necessarily experienced as benevolent by the recipient. For example, a man’s comment to a female coworker on how ‘cute’ she looks, however well-intentioned, may undermine her feelings of being taken seriously as a professional .
