            underpinnings lie in traditional stereotyping and masculine dominance (e.g., the man as the provider and woman as his dependent),
            and its consequences are often damaging. Benevolent sexism is not necessarily experienced as benevolent by the recipient. For example,
            a man’s comment to a female coworker on how ‘cute’ she looks, however well-intentioned, may undermine her feelings of being taken seriously as a professional.

When I went there I took a seat and waited for the waiter to come like any other
          restaurant but I when a mascot came out in a penguin costume I was suprised because I didn't expect it and it made the whole experience a lot more memorable.

Homosexuality was once thought to be the result of troubled family dynamics or faulty psychological development. Those assumptions
          are now understood to have been based on misinformation and prejudice. Currently there is a renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated scientific studies supporting any
          specific biological etiology for homosexuality. Similarly, no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse. Sexual abuse does not appear to be more prevalent
          in children who grow up to identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, than in children who identify as heterosexual.
