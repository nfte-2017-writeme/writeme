I actually like Canada and would like to travel there over the summer. I learned how to speak French in school and I liked learning it. The prime minester of Canada, Justin Toblerone, also seems like a great prime minister and I like the way he smiles and that he is always charismatic, unlike our president currently. I also heard a lot of rumors about how Canada is one of the most cleanest places on Earth and how the people actually pickup trash that they see on the floor and how the community actually takes part in a joint effort to make the enviornment a better place to be. I also like Canada because the name sounds nice like the CAN and ada like tada but it's CANADA. SO yea I guess you can say that I am a fan of Canada.  </textarea> </h3>

One day I felt bourgeois so I went to a resturant and it was really expensive but I thought it was worth it. When I went there I took a seat and waited for the waiter to come like any other restaurant but I when a mascot came out in a penguin costume I was suprised because I didn't expect it and it made the whole experience a lot more memorable.</textarea> </h3>

        No one knows what causes heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Homosexuality was once thought to be the result of troubled family dynamics or faulty psychological development. Those assumptions are now understood to have been based on misinformation and prejudice. Currently there is a renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality. Similarly, no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse. Sexual abuse does not appear to be more prevalent in children who grow up to identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, than in children who identify as heterosexual. </textarea></h3>
