          minister and I like the way he smiles and that he is always charismatic, unlike our president currently. I also heard a lot of rumors about how Canada is one of the most cleanest places on Earth and how the people actually pickup trash that
          they see on the floor and how the community actually takes part in a joint effort to make the enviornment a better place to be. I also like Canada because the name sounds nice like the CAN and ada like tada but it's CANADA. SO yea I guess you
          can say that I am a fan of Canada.

          restaurant but I when a mascot came out in a penguin costume I was suprised because I didn't expect it and it made the whole experience a lot more memorable.

Homosexuality was once thought to be the result of troubled family dynamics or faulty psychological development. Those assumptions
          are now understood to have been based on misinformation and prejudice. Currently there is a renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated scientific studies supporting any
          specific biological etiology for homosexuality. Similarly, no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse. Sexual abuse does not appear to be more prevalent
          in children who grow up to identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, than in children who identify as heterosexual.
