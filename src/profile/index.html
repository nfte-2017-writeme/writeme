      <p class = "question">Is school teaching you skills that you need to succeed in life?</p>
      <div class = "response"> <textarea name = "solutions" readonly class = "responsetxt">
I’m learning how to take responsibility for my own actions. If I’m late, I’m late. If I didn’t follow the school rules because I didn’t know them,
too bad, that’s not an excuse. If I didn’t do my homework, I should just admit it and do the work next time.
I think that this is an important life lesson because there’s so many adults that don’t take responsibility for what they do.
They have a child, but they don’t want to shoulder the responsibility that comes with having a child. They get into debt, but they don’t
want to “man up” and get themselves out of debt “the long way”.
If more people took responsibility for their own actions and didn’t try to take shortcuts or make excuses,
the world would be a better place. Less people would be in debt, there would be fewer numbers of abandoned children, and
perhaps parents would finally get a clue on what their children actually need, and not want.  </textarea> </div>
<p class = "question">Should Marijuana Be Legal?</p>
<div class = "response"> <textarea name = "solutions" readonly class = "responsetxt">Marijuana has been illegal for so long I understand why it has not been legalised yet, because at the end of the day people in government
  are not going to know anything other than what they have been told for years, but people have killed people when they have been drunk, people die due to smoking tobacco in huge numbers every year, no one gets hurt
  smoking marijuana ever and ever has, its seems absolutely insane I will get
  arrested for having a smoke with friends causing no trouble but I can go to a pub and get drunk and not remember anything and get into a fight. But I guess thats the backwards world we live in. I would love it to change, but it would be too easy
  for it to be legal, england always make everything harder for themselves  </textarea> </div>
<p class = "question">Do Photoshopped Images Make You Feel Bad About Your Own Looks?</p>
<div class = "response"> <textarea name = "solutions" readonly class = "responsetxt">Looking at many retouched images of celebrities and models that make them look much better and even look like Barbie is dis
  couraging, in my view. Sometimes when my friends and I see the glamorous
  models with enviably fit shape, our conversation always goes something like this: “I am trying my best to be abstemious and why on
  earth I am still fat? I am desperate for their bodies and faces.”
Sometimes those retouched images leave us dissatisfied with who we are and discouraged and desperate for models’ and celebrities’ retouched looks.
Those fake images make us think we are fat, ugly and whatsoever while the images portray something that is virtually impossible on this globe we are living
like a face without pimples or eye bags.  </textarea> </div>
